# Newton
Newton is an app that keeps track of many tasks that teachers need to do on a daily basis.
Most importantly, it uses several assessment tools that we use in class to determine the math skills students know, and which skills they are ready to tackle next.
Then, Newton gives a personal recommendation to that student to try those specific exercises on the math website IXL. (I don't have any official affiliation with IXL, we just use the program in my school)
With these recommendations, teachers are also able to look and see what skills can be taught in small-groups to help that student along.

Often, what's being taught can be either too easy or too hard for a student, so this should help to give them a list of choices for things to do on their skill level.

I am a second grade teacher, not a programmer. I learned Python and Django over the summer so that I could make this exact app. For that reason, it's an amateur program.
If you see anything in the code that can be tightened or improved, please improve on it! You'd be helping teachers teach just a bit better, and it'd be greatly appreciated.
